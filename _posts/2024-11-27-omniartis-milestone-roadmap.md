Okay, so I didn't *'come back tomorrow'*! I am very bad at not procrastinating (#asd #pda). I guess 7 days is a lot. Nevermind that. Actually, I might start doing a weekly blog. So it'll be Wednesdays for now, but that might change.

Anyway, on to the milestones. I have compiled a list (subject to change) of the milestones in my plan, each with their own due dates.

| Milestone              | Task/s                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    Due     |

| Wrap up and Release    | I will close the project and release the game for download.                                                                                                                                             | 2025-10-26 |

I will be doing each milestone in the above order, moving on when I feel each is complete enough and coming back only if I find problems with that piece of the codebase, if I am making upgrades or updates, and when I come back at the end for polishing.

## Signoff

I'll be back next time with my progress on the milestones. No promises on timeliness, but I *will* release it before the next 8 days are up.

In the meantime, have a wonderful week, and I'll see you next Wednesday(ish)!
