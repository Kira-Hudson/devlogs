Welcome to my Dev Log site. Here, I will be posting daily updates of my progress with personal projects, including any goals or ideas I have that day. I will provide a list of the tasks I had planned, the tasks I accomplished, the challenges and issues I encountered, any new ideas I had during development, and what needs to be covered next time in each of my logs.

I will also be posting weekly and monthly reviews, including milestones reached and issues resolved in that week or month.

I will not be posting anything work-related or progress on anything that is not my own project, unless I get express permission from the creator or creative director to do so, and I also *want* to document it.
