Hello again!

Sorry for the day delay, my week has been particularly busy with studies and deadlines for future prospects approaching.

## Progress Report

Week 1 has gone by quite quickly, but I managed to meet the deadline for [milestone #1]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/omniartis.html#milestones) and made a basic 3D scene with a light, a camera and 2 3D objects with Bevy.

I am now working on making interactions with the objects. I am researching different frameworks and addons for Bevy that make implementing interactions easier.

## Signoff

See you next week!
