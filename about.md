## About Me

I'm just a CS student trying to make her way in the world. My name is Kira, I'm 19 years old, and I live in the UK (so expect somewhat GMT+00 (+01 in summer) aligned activity).

I have ASD, ADHD, and some other maybes on the neuro-atypicality scale. I'm also pan and genderqueer (transfem, she/they), so if you don't like that kinda stuff, getouttahere!
